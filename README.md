# TextBased-ConnectX
This is the text-based version of my Connect-X game!

When running the default make command, all of the files needed will be compiled.
Then using 'make run' will run the game, and 'make clean' will delete all .class files created from compilation.

I have 2 versions of the "back-end" game board operations, one that has a faster running time and the other being more memory efficient.
The user will be prompted to choose which version they would like to use. Both of them provide the same experience, except performance, which is most likely not noticable by an average user.
